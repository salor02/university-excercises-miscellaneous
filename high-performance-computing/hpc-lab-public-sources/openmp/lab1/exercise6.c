 * @brief EX 6 - Task Parallelism w/tasks

 * Distribute workload among 4 threads using task directive
 * Same program as EX 5, but we had to manually unroll the loop to use sections
 * 
 * a) Create a parallel region with 4 threads. Use SINGLE directive to allow
 * only one thread to execute the loop. Use TASK directive to outline tasks.
 * b) Parallelize using SECTION
